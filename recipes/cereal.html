        <p>This is a recipe for a bowl of cereal. I think it's clear that I've lost a lot of steam on these.</p>
        <p>One of my breakfasts. Hope you enjoy it.</p>

        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Corn flakes (or whatever)</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour cereal from box into bowl. Very important that this comes first.</li>
            <li>Next, pour the milk into your cereal until all but the top layer of cereal have been coated.</li>
        </ol>
